## Notes

### Challenges Encountered

- **Checkbox and input alignment:** Aligning the Convertible checkbox and input field in the nav bar with the CREATE button required careful use of flex and consistent height styling.
- **Responsive design:** Maintaining horizontal alignment for buttons on large screens while allowing proper stacking on small screens was challenging.
- **Dynamic subtotal:** Setting up the logic to update the subtotal in real-time from the nav bar inputs was a key focus for frontend interactivity.
